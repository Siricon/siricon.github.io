In no particular order, this is an attempt to recognize and thank their creators for all the tools / platforms that enable this website to function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll Blog aware static generator engine.&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; - We use &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll Blog aware static generator engine.&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; to develop this site offline, and then post it back on to github, where the site is hosted.  Jekyll is a simple blog-aware automation for generating content from templates.  Each of these posts can be written as simple text files in any text editor, and then templates can be applied over them to create the jazzy HTML.  It still requires you to know CSS.  There is no requirement to know ruby, unless you want to develop any plugins.  We did borrow a couple of plugins and improve on them to give me what We wanted, but We could as well have gone without them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://formspree.io&quot; title=&quot;The best option for form processing on github&quot;&gt;Formspree&lt;/a&gt; - A big shout for &lt;a href=&quot;https://formspree.io&quot; title=&quot;The best option for form processing on github&quot;&gt;Formspree&lt;/a&gt; - It was the easiest way to setup and use the contacts form.  In fact, this is probably the simplest way to integrate a form into a static site.  Not even a registration was required, how much more simple can it get?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; - They claim in big bold letters on their website that “Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web” - bold as those words are, it might still be an understatement.  It is probably the one framework that gets taken for granted by ever web developer out there.  The site uses minimal customization of the vanilla bootstrap theme.  We have used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; Validation javascript, &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; CSS and &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; JS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shigeya/jekyll-monthly-archive-plugin&quot;&gt;Monthly Archive Generator&lt;/a&gt; - Shigeya Suzuki published a simple Archive generator plugin for Jekyll that have withstood the test of time.  We have modified the same to create a Yearly Archive generator as well, and these two plugins are used for the archive section of the site.  Again Simple, effective and useful.  If We were to do this again, the choice would probably be &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/edelabar/jekyll-temporal-archive-generator&quot;&gt;edalabar’s script&lt;/a&gt; that does both, but then…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And obviously, We have used the cover image from Stephen Hawking’s book - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hawking.org.uk/on-the-shoulders-of-giants.html&quot;&gt;On the shoulders of Giants&lt;/a&gt; - This has been a favourite phrase for me, ever since I learnt it, and quite aptly shows the nature of the internet technology.  Everyone who has something to show off is only building on something that hundreds of others have contributed to already.  Not sure who the original attribution for the phrase goes to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

It immediately struck me as a different program than everything I had seen before.  Dont know if this works for others, but looks good on paper as I read through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They claim to be able to teach complete novices the stack of web technologies, so that the students are able to build complete web applications within 9 weeks.  I definitely like the idea.  Having been to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firebrandtraining.co.uk/uk/cissp.asp&quot; title=&quot;CISSP&quot;&gt;CISSP&lt;/a&gt; boot camp with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firebrandtraining.com&quot;&gt;Firebrand&lt;/a&gt; recently, where I benefitted from the focus of being in such an environment, I have now come to believe that this is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things they seem to be recommending before a student joins is the Ruby Track on CodeCademy.  When I saw this, I wanted to check if my daughter and her friends at school (Year 9) would like to do this, so I have recommended the same to them.  I will update here back to see how they have done, but all these learning systems online have been exciting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gani Bhagavathula</name></author><summary type="html">I stumbled across this site called LeWagon today.
